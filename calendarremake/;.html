        As I grow old, I'm afraid of imagination.
        A slide starts to look like a hill;
    <p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

    <p>
        Happiness is always buried in something with higher priority.
        It's like a four-leaf clover in the colourful flower garden;
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p>
        Everyone knows itâ€™s difficult.
        This is our first life;   
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp</p>

    <p>
    We're the same people, yeah
Are you happy? Are you sad?
Why is it so hard to be loved?
    </p>
