    I talk about music. All the time. 
    And, one time, someone I love very much, told me "well maybe you should stop talking about music then"
   I was hurt.  
   I cried when I got home. 
   You may be thinking, "what the hell? It's not that deep"
   For you.
   For you, it may not be. And thats fine. 
   It's not fine for me.
   I always say music is my lifeline- because it is. 
   Family, friends, people, art, nature, fun- these are my lifelines too, but when they were absent...
   music wasn't. 
   To make matters worse, the majority of my life I have been bullied for simply- liking music. 
   I listened to r&b, anime, and other languages. I got bullied in middle school. 
   You thought it would stop there right?
   In high school, I was bullied for liking K-Pop. All four years. 
   I began to learn not to give a fuck. 
   I analyzied music so much to the extent that my friends couldn't understand me anymore. 
   I realize now that I feel and listen to music on a much deeper wavelength than anyone I have ever met in my life. 
    You know when you find a song and start going through the producers, composers, arrangers, mastering engineers, mixing engineers, and lyricists?
I could talk for hours about credentials and lyrically picking apart korean songs for hours, but everyone I have met just can't seem to feel passionite for that long. 

   So welcome to LÜRICAL ANALYSIS!
   I'll be taking you through an extensive deep dive into the lyrics within the korean music industry!
