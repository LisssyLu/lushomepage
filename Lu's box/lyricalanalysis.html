    I talk about music. All the time. 
    And, one time, someone I love very much, told me "well maybe you should stop talking about music then"
   I was hurt.  
   I cried when I got home. 
   <P>
   You may be thinking, "what the hell? It's not that deep"
   For you.
   For you, it may not be. And thats fine. 
   It's not fine for me.
   </p>
   <p>
   I always say music is my lifeline- because it is. 
   Family, friends, people, art, nature, fun- these are my lifelines too, but when they were absent...
   music wasn't. 
   </p>
   <p>
   To make matters worse, the majority of my life I have been bullied for simply- liking music. 
   I listened to r&b, anime, and other languages. I got bullied in middle school. 
   You thought it would stop there right?
   In high school, I was bullied for liking K-Pop. All four years. 
   </p>
   <p>
   I began to learn not to give a flying f+++. 
   </p>
   <p>
   I analyzied music so much to the extent that my friends couldn't understand me anymore. 
   I realize now that I feel and listen to music on a much deeper wavelength than anyone I have ever met in my life. 
    You know when you find a song and start going through the producers, composers, arrangers, mastering engineers, mixing engineers, and lyricists?
I could talk for hours about credentials and lyrically picking apart korean songs for hours, but everyone I have met just can't seem to feel passionite for that long. 
   </p>
   <p>
   So welcome to LYRICAL ANALYSIS!
   I'll be taking you through an extensive deep dive into the lyrics within the korean music industry!
