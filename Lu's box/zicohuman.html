    <h1> KOREAN </h1>
    <p>
<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
다를 거 없이 하찮은 하루
유독 좋은 일만 피해 갔구나
어릴 적 그림 속 어른이 된 난
분명 기쁜 표정이었는데
    </p>

<p>
<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
한 평생이 오늘까지면
발길을 돌릴 곳이 있나요
멋쩍다는 이유로
미루었던 사랑해란 말을, oh, oh
너에게 건네줘 right now
</p>


<p>
<h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
고개를 자꾸 떨구게 돼 요즘엔
마지막으로 하늘을 본 게 언젠지
흐릿해진 세상은 먼지투성이네
나 같은 사람들이 발버둥 쳤기 때문에, yeah
We always say, 나중에 그 나중에를 위해
건너뛴 생일을 빼면 여태 난 십 대
철들수록 부쩍 상상이 두려워
미끄럼틀도 서서히 비탈길로 보여
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
낯선 친절은 의심 가
뻔한 위로가 더 기운 빠져
화기애애한 대화창 속 넌 정말 웃고 있을까
거리낌 없이 아무 데나 걷기엔
피해야 될 것이 너무 많은 곳에서
태어날 때나 늙어갈 때
움츠린 채 사는 우리
</p>


<p>
<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
다를 거 없이 하찮은 하루
유독 좋은 일만 피해 갔구나
어릴 적 그림 속 어른이 된 난
분명 기쁜 표정이었는데
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
한 평생이 오늘까지면
발길을 돌릴 곳이 있나요
멋쩍다는 이유로
미루었던 사랑해란 말을, oh, oh
너에게 건네줘 right now
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Verse 3]</h3>
조심해, 시간은 무섭게 속력을 낼 거야
넘어지지 않게 서로 손잡이가 되어줘
개인이 할 수 있는 일은 실망밖에 없어
터질 듯 쌓여버린 이야기보따리를 풀어
삶은 교묘한 장난을 안 멈춰, uh
네가 공짜로 생명을 얻은 날부터, uh
우선시되는 무언가에 늘 묻혀있지 행복은
화려한 꽃밭 틈에서 찾는 네잎 클로버
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Verse 4]</h3>
나쁜 마음씨를 들킬까
너 나 할 것 없이 눈치 봐
걱정 마, 좀 부족해도 누군가는
인간다움을 느껴
남의 눈에 좋은 사람이기 전에
나 자신한테 먼저 화해를 청해
어렵다는 거 모두가 알아
이번이 처음 살아 보는 거잖아
</p>


<p>
<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
다를 거 없이 하찮은 하루
유독 좋은 일만 피해 갔구나
어릴 적 그림 속 어른이 된 난
분명 기쁜 표정이었는데
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
한 평생이 오늘까지면
발길을 돌릴 곳이 있나요
멋쩍다는 이유로
미루었던 사랑해란 말을, oh, oh
너에게 건네줘 right now
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Outro]</h3>
We're the same
We're the same
We're the same people, yeah
Are you happy? Are you sad?
Why is it so hard to be loved?
We're the same
We're the same
We're the same people, yeah
Are you happy? Are you sad?
We need love
</p>


<h1> ENGLISH </h1>

<p>
<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
It's a trivial day with nothing special
Only good things avoided me
I became an adult since the pictures of my childhood
I clearly looked happy
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
If my whole life ends today
Which direction should I go towards?
By reason of feeling awkward
I put off saying I love you, oh, oh
I say this to you right now
</p>


<p>
<h3> [Verse 1]</h3>
I keep lowering my head these days
When did I last look up to the sky?
The blurred world is filled with dust
Because people like me struggled, yeah
We always say, later, for the later
Without my skipped birthdays I’m still in my teens
As I grow old, I'm afraid of imagination
A slide starts to look like a hill
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
I'm suspicious about strange acts of kindness
An obvious comfort lets me down more
Are you really smiling in a hearty conversation
In a place with too many things to avoid
To walk anywhere without hesitation
When we’re born or grow old
We're living by cowering
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
It's a trivial day with nothing special
Only good things avoided me
I became an adult since the pictures of my childhood
I clearly looked happy
</p>


<p>
<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
If my whole life ends today
Which direction should I go towards?
By reason of feeling awkward
I put off saying I love you, oh, oh
I say this to you right now
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Verse 3]</h3>
Be careful, time will dramatically speed up
Please hold onto each other so that you don't fall
The only thing individuals can do is be disappointed
Untie the piled up bundle of stories
Life doesn't stop subtle mischief, uh
From the day you had your life for free, uh
Happiness is always buried in something with higher priority
It's like a four-leaf clover in the colourful flower garden
</p>


<p>
<h3>[Verse 4]</h3>
For fear that others discover our evil minds
We all read each other's face
Don't worry, even if it’s not enough
Someone will feel humanity
Before becoming a good person to others
I should ask to reconcile with myself first
Everyone knows it’s difficult
This is our first life
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
It's a trivial day with nothing special
Only good things avoided me
I became an adult since the pictures of my childhood
I clearly looked happy
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Chorus]</h3>
If my whole life ends today
Which direction should I go towards?
By reason of feeling awkward
I put off saying I love you, oh, oh
I say this to you right now
</p>

<p>
<h3>[Outro]<h3>
We’re the same
We're the same
We're the same people, yeah
Are you happy? Are you sad?
Why is it so hard to be loved?
We're the same
We’re the same
We're the same people, yeah
Are you happy? Are you sad?
We need love

My Interpretation and analysis
</p>

    <p>

To give some background...
ZICO has been a genius when it comes tohis lyricism and writing skills as well. 
I think ZICO is looked up to by many male rappers within the music industry. I mean, Ive watched 
ZICO since bremuda triangle and hes insanley grown to popularity and gained the attention across tik tok as well. 
in fact, his popularity really boosted as soon as "any song" came out but, ZICO has always had this signature sound with him because of his vocal tone and color. 

Anyways, fast forward and now hes created his own company, KOZ, which is home to BOYNEXTDOOR and DVWN. Although KOZ is under HYBE corp now, 
he still proves his skills after every single he releases. 
    </p>

    <p>
As far as structure and scene direction for this song and music video go, Im giving it a solid 10/10. 
The overall theme for the song human contains topics around time, death, memories, life, and childhood. 
the chorus itself is "if my life ends today, which direction should i go towards?". i think when it comes to 
most mainstream korean music, they dont necessarily directly state out things that everyone thinks. for example, many 
korean songs will either write in a way where you have to rearrange the sentence or chorus to understand the true meaing, or others will 
write it in metaphorical ways. 
So, when this song came out, i was shocked. 
im gonna stop writing in capital letters because its hurting my hands and also if there are grammatical errors, yall can put two and two together hopefully by now!

anyways, i was saying, zico was really straightforward with not only that line, but the many other parts of the song. 
i remeber when i first saw and listened to this music video, i cried. 
why? because everything he says, to me, is true. 

he says that hes afraid of imagination as he gets older because now, what seemed like a slide starts to look like a steep hill.   
i love the way he writes about losing yourself to adulthood and throwing away your youth and inner child, which to me, is a huge problem this world has. 

THE BEST LINE IN THIS ENTIRE SONG IS: Happiness is always buried in something with higher priority It's like a four-leaf clover in the colourful flower garden. 
when you really think about it, isint he right? i mean we always say we have our high and lows but nowadays, doesnt it feel like 
we cant even get a break? like we cant even be happy because we just know something negative is going to happen anyways? 
ive used this line so many times and ive talked to people about it too and everytime, they are usually quiet. 
either they didnt listen, or they are just stumped in their thought because i guess they didnt think someone could write something like that. 



i was looking at the lyrics wondering why the last outro chorus was the only lines in english. although i could really care less about the english 
language being used in korean songs, this one here makes sense. 

lets say zico wanted to reach as many humans with this song. the outro was the best option for that and every time the line 
"are you happy? are you sad?" is said, i hope people actually, genuienley, think about it. i hope a lot of people get brought 
together by this song and i wish i could talk to more people about it too.
