    if you havent already, i would head over and listen to NANGMAN by BIG NAUGHTY. i cant get over how much of an artist big naughty is.
    i started watching show me the money, a korean hip hop survival show, in 2016. 
    i think if i can remember right, big naughty first appeared on smtm8. 
    his audition was good and when he made it to the second round, he performed a song that is now called 
    "where it all started" and he refferenced a huge rapper- beenzino. 
    everyone loved his audition and ultimatley he soared through season 8. 
    </p>


<p>
    anyways, big naughty has always been the shit and will forever be the shit because hes such a young rapper 
    when he started but his skill, vocal, rap, lyrical, and technical levels were up with people like 
    beenzino, khundi panda, haon, coogie, and loco. hes amazing at what he does and in an interview, he mentioned
    that he doesnt see himself as a rapper, but just as is- as an artist.

<p>
    in romance symphony, it starts off with calm keys that almost sound like theyre underwater. then we slowly get introduced to strings. 
    after that, we can hear faint saxaphones and trumpets. as soon as big naughty mentions the word piano, the song 
    instumental immediatley switched to piano. small things can create dramatic or big effects and this is one of them. 
</p>



<p>
    in the chorus, everythign comes together with all the istruments, but he mainly intriduces us to trumpets and saxaphones. sometimes these instruments can be alarming 
    or loud to some people who arent used to listening to jazz, classical, or synth music. radio mainstream music im looking at you. 
    big naughty makes an adlib or a sound with his voice. 
</p>

<p>
    at first when people listen, they might think that the sound is an actual instrument, when in fact, its his own voice altering that he added in there. 
    i had to watch a live version just to see for myself how the hell he did that.
