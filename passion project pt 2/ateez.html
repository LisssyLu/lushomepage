<p> can i start off by saying that to this day i have no clue why ateez is so underapprecated?
    i can not stress how much i dont hear ateez name when chreo or dance in kpop comes up. 
    except now, after guerilla and bouncy, ateez is finally starting to be recognized for their impecable performance and dancing skills. also vocally as well obviously since people forgot about that too. 
    when artist have a job to do and they are getting paid, youu would expect everyone to do just that- their job. but ateez goes above and beyond every single time i see them. 
    i had the chance to see ateez in concert in 2019 and it was one of the best concerts ive been to where they danced their ass off throughout the ENTIRE CONCERT.

        <p> In ATEEZ HALAZIA, they tried a new concept and shocked fans when the music video came out too. This album was a different texture and everything musically and concept wise. 
            so it didnt suprise me when i saw the dance for the first time and saw some new intresting moves. 
            the imagrey at 0:39 is insane beacuse of the amount of strength you have to have with your team in order to pull this off anyways. these kind of imagrey moves always remind me of the competitive show road to kingdom
            where sunwoo from the boys was afraid of heights but he pulled off a stunt anyways for the team. if you couldnt notice seonghwa is to the left on anothe dancers leg, which if this segment was longer, it would be painful to hold this move. 
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
         0:59 this is the segment i was blown away by. as the song begins to slow down, quite literally the beat and snares and drums start to disappear, 
         the hands of the members spread away in this ripple effect and the viewers are just waiting to see what they pull off next. i love these kinds of breaths of moments of anticipation. 
         the next part is such a fast pace that if you blink you will miss it. sometimes i also have trouble like some other dancers when it comes to left andd right arm coordination with whatever i am viewing. 

         &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
    <p>



         the craziest part of this choreo is at the timestamp 2:48.
         this segment is fast paced and san jumps at leat two to three feet in the air or what it seems like idek but hes insane for that one. 
         people usually dont pay attention to backup dancers, but in this, its kind of ahrd to not pay attention to them because they appear out of nowhere!

and at the end, if one member is off beat with the sound of the bell of halazia, the choreo is thrown off. so far in every performance i have seenof ateex, they never miss a beat.
