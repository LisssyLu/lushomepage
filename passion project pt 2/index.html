<h1> Welcome to choreo analysis!</h1>
<h4> Dont worry. You dont have to know how to dance to be able to analyze it!</h2>
  
    <p> Ive loved to dance since I was younger. When I was around the age of 11, I started watching Matt Stefinina and Wildabeast's dance videos on youtube. Every day, I was intrigued with these videos to the point where I started developing muscle memory from watching the videos on repeat!
        I would bring my best friends over, who at the time were also intrested in choreography, and we would dance until we were sweating and our muscles were sore. I started dancing in front of the mirror, but I never took it to a professional level. It has stayed at a freeform style of dancing because I found a deeper passion through these times. 
        Analyzing choreography along with the<b>music</b>. I began to compare dance routines and really dig deeper into choreography. Unfortunatley, during this time, I also had to have knee surgery. I was devastated. However, my passion grew from that point on. Sure, I cant dance very well or the same, but I began to analyze every bit and piece of choreo I could get my hands on.
        If I had to say it aloud, I would say one of my strong niches is analyzing the choreography within the korean music entertainment industry. 
        I'll be showing you what I think about some of the choreographies within this industry and giving you analytical feedback! Watch out for some special guests in the future as well!
        *i need to check for spelling and fix this later ._.
