    <h1>&TEAM</h1>

    <p> Under the Skin has got to be one of the hardest choreographies I have ever attempted. From the spinning and twirling power moves to the fast pace, this song will definetly have you sweating. 
        Considering the fact that this is also their debut song, it makes it even more mind boggling for me. Usually in K-Pop, the first comeback is impressive, but I have never seen something so technically challenged as this. 
    </p>

    <p>I can see why not a lot of people are not covering this song, because it is difficult to do if you 1. dont practice with a group consistently and 2. if synchronization is not in the books for your group.</p>
</p>


<p>
some key takeaways: 
- 2: 38 and 2: 54 (use of hand imagry by creating images of moons, flowers, spaces with motion)
- 0:57 (the iconic and difficult 360 spin move)
</p>

<p>'FIREWORK' was their first comeback after 'Under the Skin' was released, and yet, once again, &TEAM suprised me with this one. 
    I figured that &TEAM would have difficult choreos after wastching Under the Skin, but I underestimated FIREWORK.
