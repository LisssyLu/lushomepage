    <h1> Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House  </h1>
<p>
    ive read this website before but it was with professor Julia! 
I forget that social media websites are not meant primarily to satisfy/make someone happy. Each place has their own mission and reason and most times, as we can tell by interacting with them, that is the case. 
this is why I like the more simple and easy to navigate and modern/classical types of websites. 
I enjoy reading and coming back to the thought of oh yeah a website can be a room a plant a shelf and so on because I think I forget about that. I think too close minded when it comes to websites because all I know is the basic blueprint.

    <h1> Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology</h1>
<p>
    “high tech doesnt mean that other teach is necessarily low”
I agree that I think now a days, we do think about technology as electronic or requiring it, but really its anything that we dont know how to make or do according to this author. 
“everyone can learn, thats why were here”.

   <h1> J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h1>
   <p>
   Its intresting how physical things work versus fictional. 
   in this reading, he says that when people read a book in real life, they stopped at the end because that was all there was to it- the end of the book- literally the last word on the page. 
   Digitally; however, things can live on forever which makes me think of sad instances where rude people will go and comment things that are just sensless to peole and unfortunatley other see that and its stuck on there forever, either digitally or mentally. 
   I wish the times were quieter like they were in the past, it was easier to live that way.

<h1> Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!</h1>
<p>
    My immediate thought was these drawings are so cute and right up my alley. I think most people including myself have trouble reading things that are in boring fonts or no images included because of the way we process information and the way our attention spans work too. The saying that sat with me is that life can’t just be binary. There’s no way it can just be this or that and nothing else. There is common grounds for a reason in life. I thought the drawing of the iPad was funny because we could recognize it even if it isn’t 100% accurate.

<h1> Callum copley- A Freind Is Writing </h1>
<p>At first glance and interaction, this site is very overwhelming. 
    And even now, I still think its overwhelming. 
    I like how its at least organized by color but the notifications are just triggering and traumatizing for me anyways.
     Especially now a days, I can’t handle more than one text or thing happening in my life at a time.
      But eventually, the notifications on the website stopped; I was so glad because it was getting annoying.
       I didn’t understand number one but I understood number 2. 
       The dot dot dot. A feeling of uncertainty in the English language and many others as well. 
       Which leads to premeditation or what I understood from this text is that nobody has patience. 
       Even when I was younger I was always saying I don’t have time for shit and I still… don’t have time for shit! 
       Aint nothing changed. Anyways, I am really not sure like the full purpose of the site but ummmm it was slightly boring to me idk. 
       Maybe im being a hater or it just didn’t click with me.
        I felt like it was telling the viewers metaphors or analogies that most already knew about social media, work, and life and its happiness. </p>

<h1>        Mindy Seu- The Poetry of Tools </h1>

        <p>
 
        One of the first things I noticed in this article was the word defamiliarize, which I find hard to do because my brain can’t function like that most of the time. Sometimes, it makes me laugh because why are we trying so hard to defamiliarize with things that aren’t real priority issues in todays world? I don’t know the answer either. 
        I chose to focus on the production of errors topic. I found this interesting because a lot of times in the business world, well talk about human error, especially in accounting. And we try to “fix” human error with technology or the excel spread sheet or with coding. However, humans are still running these things which leads me to question can anything be “fixed or corrected”? I guess that’s the whole point of errors, maybe its just a part of life and we shouldn’t be trying to fix it? Once again this is something I don’t know the answers to.

        <h1> Becca Abbe, The internet's Back-To-The-Land-Movement</h1>

        When I first started reading this, my immediate thought was that it was
         very relevant to the state of right now. Unless we do something, nothing will change 
         for the better. It’s also funny how the article is mentioning how many copies something 
         sold because of the context that it is talking in. By this I mean that if a point of 
         this article was to be like environmental friendly, selling millions of copies is quite 
         the opposite approach. I do agree; however, with the statement that we eventually will
          need to go off grid and create our own things in order to continue to be sustainable and live healthy in this world.

            <h1> The Good Room by Frank Chimero</h1>
         <P> The first thing I nodded my head to was the fact that everyones attention
           in todays world is cut very, very, short. I am unsure when this change 
           started to take place, but teachers and leaders noticed this in almost every 
           field and situation that people were in; which is absolutely insane and sad to 
           think about if I am being honest. I also want to say that BTS performed at the grand
            terminal which reminded me of the penn station images, and they had to shut it down 
            obviously for filming purposes. The web being a market place is something as a consumer, 
            I  am so sick and tired of seeing and then on the other hand, because I am an artist, 
            something I have to use to make profit and survive in America. See, in America, its so 
            unsafe to the point of mind boggling anxiety every single day. If I told someone I was
             going into the woods with no form of technology they would do one or more of these 
             things: gasp, laugh, have a confused or judgmental look on their face, shake their
              head, or start asking a bunch of questions. We can’t do things like this anymore- 
              its far too dangerous and makes no sense to do at this day and age. Its funny the 
              differences me and the author have. There is a point where happiness takes form in
               what people think is not good for the mind or body. For example, NETFLIX. I watch
                Netflix films and shows because I have a passion for films and shows and part of 
                my happiness in life comes from watching things that make me feel emotions. Today 
                though, I do start to question what is the meaning of all of this technology and my 
                future career and who will I even bring happiness to at the end of the day? I do not
                 know those answers and therefore, no one else knows those answers either. Including 
                 the person that wrote this article. Also, I just checked my time I used Spotify 
                 today- it runs at 35 min- but that is just with the app open and running. It really 
                 turned out to be around 3 hours of
           listening time or with the app closed and music running in the background.  
         </P>
