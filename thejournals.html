    <h1> Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House  </h1>
<p>
    ive read this website before but it was with professor Julia! 
I forget that social media websites are not meant primarily to satisfy/make someone happy. Each place has their own mission and reason and most times, as we can tell by interacting with them, that is the case. 
this is why I like the more simple and easy to navigate and modern/classical types of websites. 
I enjoy reading and coming back to the thought of oh yeah a website can be a room a plant a shelf and so on because I think I forget about that. I think too close minded when it comes to websites because all I know is the basic blueprint.

    <h1> Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology</h1>
<p>
    “high tech doesnt mean that other teach is necessarily low”
I agree that I think now a days, we do think about technology as electronic or requiring it, but really its anything that we dont know how to make or do according to this author. 
“everyone can learn, thats why were here”.

   <h1> J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h1>
   <p>
   ITS INTRESTING HOW PHYSICAL THINGS WORK VERSUS FIGITAL.
    IN THIS READING HE SAYS THAT WHEN PEOPLE READ A BOOK IN REAL LIFE THEY STOPPED AT THE END CUZ THAT WAS IT. 
    BUT DIGITALLY THINGS CAN LIVE ON FOREVER AS THE COPS SAY IT HAHA. IM STILL TRYING TO PROCESS WHY I COLLECT TRINKETS AND ALBUMS WHEN IN PERSON THEY END, BUT ON MY PHONE I CAN KEEP IT FOREVER.
     SAME THING WITH MEMORIES. 
     I WILL FORGET ONCE I GET OLDER SO I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE THEM NOW. 
     I AGREE THAT I WISH TIMES WERE QUIETER THAN NOW. 
     IT WAS EASIER TO LIVE THAT WAY AND NOW EVERYONE HAS TO DEAL WITH MEAN AND RUDE PEOPLE EVEN ONLINE AND THAT SHIT HURTS.
