    <h1> Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House  </h1>
<p>
    ive read this website before but it was with professor Julia! 
I forget that social media websites are not meant primarily to satisfy/make someone happy. Each place has their own mission and reason and most times, as we can tell by interacting with them, that is the case. 
this is why I like the more simple and easy to navigate and modern/classical types of websites. 
I enjoy reading and coming back to the thought of oh yeah a website can be a room a plant a shelf and so on because I think I forget about that. I think too close minded when it comes to websites because all I know is the basic blueprint.

    <h1> Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology</h1>
<p>
    “high tech doesnt mean that other teach is necessarily low”
I agree that I think now a days, we do think about technology as electronic or requiring it, but really its anything that we dont know how to make or do according to this author. 
“everyone can learn, thats why were here”.

   <h1> J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h1>
   <p>
   Its intresting how physical things work versus fictional. 
   in this reading, he says that when people read a book in real life, they stopped at the end because that was all there was to it- the end of the book- literally the last word on the page. 
   Digitally; however, things can live on forever which makes me think of sad instances where rude people will go and comment things that are just sensless to peole and unfortunatley other see that and its stuck on there forever, either digitally or mentally. 
   I wish the times were quieter like they were in the past, it was easier to live that way.
