    <h1> Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House  </h1>
<p>
    ive read this website before but it was with professor Julia! 
I forget that social media websites are not meant primarily to satisfy/make someone happy. Each place has their own mission and reason and most times, as we can tell by interacting with them, that is the case. 
this is why I like the more simple and easy to navigate and modern/classical types of websites. 
I enjoy reading and coming back to the thought of oh yeah a website can be a room a plant a shelf and so on because I think I forget about that. I think too close minded when it comes to websites because all I know is the basic blueprint.

    <h1> Ursula K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology</h1>
<p>
    “high tech doesnt mean that other teach is necessarily low”
I agree that I think now a days, we do think about technology as electronic or requiring it, but really its anything that we dont know how to make or do according to this author. 
“everyone can learn, thats why were here”.

   <h1> J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web</h1>
   <p>
   Its intresting how physical things work versus fictional. 
   in this reading, he says that when people read a book in real life, they stopped at the end because that was all there was to it- the end of the book- literally the last word on the page. 
   Digitally; however, things can live on forever which makes me think of sad instances where rude people will go and comment things that are just sensless to peole and unfortunatley other see that and its stuck on there forever, either digitally or mentally. 
   I wish the times were quieter like they were in the past, it was easier to live that way.

<h1> Taeyoon Choi, Hello World!</h1>
<p>
    My immediate thought was these drawings are so cute and right up my alley. I think most people including myself have trouble reading things that are in boring fonts or no images included because of the way we process information and the way our attention spans work too. The saying that sat with me is that life can’t just be binary. There’s no way it can just be this or that and nothing else. There is common grounds for a reason in life. I thought the drawing of the iPad was funny because we could recognize it even if it isn’t 100% accurate.

<h1> Callum copley- A Freind Is Writing </h1>
<p>At first glance and interaction, this site is very overwhelming. 
    And even now, I still think its overwhelming. 
    I like how its at least organized by color but the notifications are just triggering and traumatizing for me anyways.
     Especially now a days, I can’t handle more than one text or thing happening in my life at a time.
      But eventually, the notifications on the website stopped; I was so glad because it was getting annoying.
       I didn’t understand number one but I understood number 2. 
       The dot dot dot. A feeling of uncertainty in the English language and many others as well. 
       Which leads to premeditation or what I understood from this text is that nobody has patience. 
       Even when I was younger I was always saying I don’t have time for shit and I still… don’t have time for shit! 
       Aint nothing changed. Anyways, I am really not sure like the full purpose of the site but ummmm it was slightly boring to me idk. 
       Maybe im being a hater or it just didn’t click with me.
        I felt like it was telling the viewers metaphors or analogies that most already knew about social media, work, and life and its happiness. </p>
